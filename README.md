# üëã Greetings traveller!
Hi, I‚Äôm Euan! (*@egmair*). Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a full-stack developer with 8+ years experience in .NET technologies and design, delivery and support of customer-focused solutions. Initially I joined the industry as a trainee SharePoint developer where I honed my skills to provide top quality service consistently throughout my time at [abrdn](https://www.abrdn.com/en-gb) (formerly Aberdeen Standard Investments/Aberdeen Asset Management).

Since my days working with SharePoint & .NET Framework, I have moved on into a full-stack developer role within the Integration Team at [MINTRA](https://mintra.com/). We are a leading provider of HCM software for safety-critical sectors such as energy and maritime. At MINTRA, I primarily work with .NET Core and Angular but also support legacy applications hosted on .NET Framework.
